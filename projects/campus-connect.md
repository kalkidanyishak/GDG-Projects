A unified platform to simplify academic life, boost student engagement, and centralize campus information.

---

# 1. One-Page Project Overview

## Project Name
Campus Connect

## Vision
Create a single digital home for students — combining academics, engagement, convenience, and career opportunities into one accessible platform.

## The Problem
University life is chaotic because information is scattered across:
- Telegram channels  
- Paper announcements  
- WhatsApp groups  
- Random websites  
- Word-of-mouth  

This leads to:
- Missed events  
- Difficulty finding academic resources  
- Trouble finding study or project partners  
- No platform for clubs to communicate  
- No centralized job board  
- Low student engagement and poor information flow  

## Proposed Solution
A mobile-friendly web platform that includes:
- Academic resources and calendar  
- Community feed for discussions, confessions, questions, and help  
- Clubs and events hub  
- Study buddy and project buddy matching  
- Lost & found board  
- Internships and job listings  
- Profile system with points, skills, and batch/section matching  
- Administrative announcements  
- Marketplace, polls, galleries, and additional features in future releases  

## Target Users
- Students (primary)  
- Club leaders  
- Campus administrators  
- Alumni (future)  
- Local businesses (future)  

## Core Value Propositions
- Centralize all campus-related information  
- Increase student engagement and interaction  
- Provide essential academic and career tools  
- Improve communication between clubs, administrators, and students  
- Foster a connected and collaborative campus community  

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- 500+ weekly active users  
- 10+ daily posts in the community feed  
- 5+ events created weekly  
- 20+ study/project buddy matches monthly  
- 50% of active clubs using the platform
